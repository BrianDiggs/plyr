plyr 0.1.6 (2008-XX-XX) ---------------------------------------------------

* use list names where present
* failwith now accepts a function name, as well as a function itself
* each now accepts function names, as well as a functions
* fix typo that was causing a 50% speed penalty for d*ply
* aaply now works with vectors
* fix bug in daply which prevented it from working correctly when data frame was split by multiple variables
* all ply functions deal more elegantly when given function names: can supply a vector of function names, and name is used as label in output

plyr 0.1.5 (2008-02-23) ---------------------------------------------------

* colwise now accepts a quoted list as its second argument.  This allows you to specify the names of columns to work on: colwise(mean, .(lat, long))
* d_ply and a_ply now correctly pass ... to the function

plyr 0.1.4 (2008-12-12) ---------------------------------------------------

 * Greatly improved speed (> 10x faster) and memory usage (50%) for splitting data frames with many combinations
 * Splitting variables containing missing values now handled consistently

plyr 0.1.3 (2008-11-19) ---------------------------------------------------

Fixed problem where when splitting by a variable that contained missing values, missing combinations would be drop, and labels wouldn't match up

plyr 0.1.2 (2008-11-18) ---------------------------------------------------

  * a*ply now works correctly with array-lists
  * drop. -> .drop
  * r*ply now works with ...
  * use inherits instead of is so method package doesn't need to be loaded
  * fix bug with using formulas

plyr 0.1.1 (2008-10-08) ---------------------------------------------------

  * argument names now start with . (instead of ending with it) - this should prevent name clashes with arguments of the called function 
  * return informative error if .fun is not a function
  * use full names in all internal calls to avoid argument name clashes
